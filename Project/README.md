# Antarctica Climate Change 
This modeling project is an example to demonstrate the approximate scope, files, and organization of a class project for CS 185C.

## Project Description
In this project, I will explore the changes in sea temperature around Antarctica to answer the following science question:

*How has significantly has global warming impacted Antarctica's sea surface temperature over the past three decades?*

To investigate this question, I will construct a model capturing Antarctica and its surrounding seas. I will run my experiment during the years 2024, 2014, 2004, and 1994 to record sea surface temperature and their mean temperatures. I anticipate that hte model will depict higher mean temperatures each decade between 1994 and 2024, with the mean temperature change of each decade being larger than the last. 

For initial conditions, I will use the state of the ECCO Version 5 Model in January 1994, 2004, 2014, and 2024. Similarly, I will construct boundary and external forcing conditions for this model from the ECCO Version 5 model output. To analyze the results, I will visually and mathematically compare the average sea temperatures of each decade. For visualization, I will create a movie depicting gradual changes in Antarctica's sea temperature throughout the decades.
