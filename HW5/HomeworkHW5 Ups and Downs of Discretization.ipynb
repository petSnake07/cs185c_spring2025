    "In this scenario, the weight has mass $m$ and the string has a certain \"stiffness\". Further, we may consider friction on the track as the mass moves back and forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Physical Setting\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three laws that describe the setting:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hooke's Law\n",
    "Hooke's law dictates that a spring experiences a restoring force which is proportional to its displacement. The constant of proportionality ($k$) reflects the stiffness of the spring. The force is written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_{Hooke} = -kx\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Friction\n",
    "An object in motion along a surface experiences a force proportional to its speed. The constant of proportionality ($\\mu$) reflects the \"bumpiness\" of the surface. The force is written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_{friction} = -\\mu x'\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Newton's Second Law\n",
    "Newton's second law indicates that the forces on an object are equal to its mass times its acceleration, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = ma = mx''\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Differential Equation\n",
    "By equating the total force $F$ to that of friction and Hooke's law, we can formulate the differential equation for the solution as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x''(t) + \\frac{\\mu}{m}x'(t) + \\frac{k}{m}x(t) = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Initial Conditions\n",
    "If we'd like to predict the full trajectory of our mass on the spring through time we also need to have the initial conditions - where it starts and how fast it is moving. For this example, let's consider that we stretch the spring a give distance $x_0$ from is starting position and let it go from there. In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "x(0) &= x_0\\\\\n",
    "x'(0) &= 0\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_0$ is the initial displacement of the weight and $0$ represents the initial velocity of the weight (at rest). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note:\n",
    "For this homework, assume that $\\mu = 0$ so that there is no friction and the equation simplifies to \n",
    "$$\n",
    "x''(t) + \\frac{k}{m}x(t) = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Complete the following parts with this assumption.\n",

    "#### Optional Challenge\n",
