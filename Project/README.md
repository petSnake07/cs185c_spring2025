# Antarctica Climate Change 
This modeling project is an example to demonstrate the approximate scope, files, and organization of a class project for CS 185C.

## Project Description
In this project, I will explore the changes in sea temperature around Antarctica to answer the following scientific question:

*How has global warming significantly impacted Antarctica's sea surface temperature over the past decade?*

I will construct a model capturing Antarctica and its surrounding seas to investigate this question. I will run my experiment during the years 2017 and 2007 to record sea surface temperature and its mean temperatures. I anticipate that the model will depict a significantly higher mean temperatures each decade between 2007 and 2017/

For initial conditions, I will use the state of the ECCO Version 5 Model in January 2007 and 2017. Similarly, I will construct boundary and external forcing conditions for this model from the ECCO Version 5 model output. To analyze the results, I will visually and mathematically compare the average sea temperatures of each decade. For visualization, I will create a movie depicting gradual changes in Antarctica's sea temperature throughout the decades.
